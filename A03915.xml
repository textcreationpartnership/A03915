            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

May it pleaſe your <hi>Grace</hi> therfore to remember, that firſt this matter of

the <hi>Croſse in Baptiſme,</hi> is that great ſtumbling block, whereat al our diſcontented brethren doe take offence; &amp; ſecondly, that in this ſmall Treatiſe al the chiefeſt arguments which they vſually make againſt this ſigne, are comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Eſpecially becauſe my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was, to giue iuſt ſatiſfaction to euery ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and to leaue nothing vnanſwered, that might ſeeme to carry any waight of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which courſe, as I held throughout the whol Treatiſe in generall, ſo more eſpecially in the laſt part.

The Treatiſer more ouer, not only ſomwhat in every part of the Treatiſe, but fully and of reſolued &amp; ſetled purpoſe in the laſt part, maketh great vaunt, that either the Ancient fathers in their times v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not this ſigne at al in Baptiſme, or if they did, they vſed it to far other purpoſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do now; or laſtly, if they vſed it to any ſuch end yet euen in them it was neuer free from ſinne,

                  <p>Concerning the firſt, that no humane ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is to be vſed in the ſeruice of god, I would faine knowe of the Treatiſer what he meaneth <hi>by the ſeruice of god.</hi> Jf he meane (<hi>preaching,</hi> which to that ſect is now become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only ſeruice of god) J will propoſe ſuch plaine matter againſt his aſſertion, as himſelfe ſhal not be able to contradict. The ſentences which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> borrowed out of heathen Poers, <hi>Aratus.</hi> Acts 17.28. <hi>Menander,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.33. <hi>Epimenides,</hi> Titus. 1.12. were firſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuention: for ſo the Apoſtle expreſſly citeth two of them in there ſeuerall places.

                  <p>Secondly, if by the <hi>ſervice of God</hi> he vnderſtande the <hi>Leiturgie</hi> and forme of divine ſervice and praier, then I demaunde what manner of <hi>Leiturgie</hi> there was in the Church of the Jewes till the time of our Saviour. For wee are not to imagine, that in their dayly ſacrifices, in their Sabbaths, and new moones, &amp; other feſtival daies, men aſſembled only to performe the bare outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of killing their ſacrifices, and offring their oblations,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4537:8"/>
without any forme of praier and Leiturgie for ſuch holy purpoſes. And yet thoſe outward actions only are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and regiſtred vnto vs, as being of Gods inſtitution, and thoſe other of praier, and thankſgiving, &amp; vocall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the congregation (if any ſuch were, as certainely they were) are paſſed over in ſilence without any record or remembrance; which makes me to conceaue (and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſhal remaine in that opinion til I be reformed) that al other complements were wholy left, &amp; permitted to the direction of the Prieſts. For had there been any ſuch formes of praier and thankſgiuing inſtituted by God, they would (noe doubt) ether haue beene recorded by Moſes, aſwell as there forme of bleſſing the people, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Numb: 6.24. or preſerued as ſafe as the other Ceremonies and rites of there ſacrifices. And herein J am the rather confirmed by the Titles and Inſcriptions of divers pſalmes, which in the times of thoſe oblations &amp; ſacrifices were vſed in holy meetings. But the whole manner of ordering and diſpoſing of them ſeemeth to haue beene in the Prieſts and Leuites, and them that had the chiefe gouernment in holy aſſemblies. For ſo much both the ſending of diuers pſalmes to the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or him, that excelled in muſicke as <hi>Ieduthune, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph,</hi> the ſonns of <hi>Corah:</hi> and the names of certaine Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, or tunes whereto they were to be ſet, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginoth, Shoſhannim, Alamoth,</hi> and ſuch like, doe moſt manifeſtly import. Alſo I would faine know of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſer whether the appointing of the Singers, Prieſts, and Levites in their orders and courſes, which is aſcribed to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. to <hi>It hoida,</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 23.18. to <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> 2. <hi>chron.</hi> 31.2. were a humane ordinance, or noe? for that it was vſed in Gods ſeruice, theſe alledged places
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4537:9"/>
ſufficiently teſtifie: and that it was a humane ordinance inſtituted firſt by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and renewed afterward by thoſe others, theſe places following plainly affirme. The ſong of the Lord began with the trumpets &amp; inſtruments of <hi>David</hi> King of Jſraell. 2. <hi>Chron:</hi> 29.27. <hi>Ezechias</hi> the King and Princes commaunded the <hi>Levites,</hi> to praiſe the Lord with the words of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph</hi> the kings ſeer. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. and after the captivitie, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the Prieſt, and <hi>Zerubbabell</hi> the governour, appointed the Prieſts in their apparel with trumpets, &amp; the <hi>Levites</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Aſaph</hi> with Cymbals, to praiſe the Lord after the ordinance of <hi>Dauid</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael. Eſra:</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly if by the <hi>ſeruice of God,</hi> he meane the <hi>outward ceremonies</hi> of our religious carriage, and behavior while we are in the Church hearing Gods word, and praying vnto him in the congregation, I woulde knowe whether thoſe ordinances which the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribeth That women ſhould keepe ſilence in the Church 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. That men ſhould pray bare headed and women couered. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. That men comming togither to the Lords ſupper ſhould ſtay one for another, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane feaſting ſhould not be mingled with the Lordes Supper. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.17. whether J ſaie theſe, and many ſuch like were of humane inſtitution or diuine? Jf they were of mans ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, then the Treatiſer is much miſtaken, for al theſe belonged to the ſervice of God, if they were not of humane but diuine inſtitution, how then doth he cal them <hi>My things, The ordinances that I haue deliuered?</hi> 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 11.2. and why ſpeakes he not in Gods perſon, but his owne? <hi>I will</hi> that men pray euery where lifting vp pure hands. That women array them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in comely apparel. 1. <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.8.9. and, <hi>I permit</hi> not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4537:9"/>
a woman to teach. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Jf the Treatiſer ſhal ſay that in al theſe examples formerly alleadged, thoſe men were ledde by the ſpirit of God, &amp; therfore what ſoeuer they appointed was Gods ordinance, my anſwere there vnto is, that now alſo the Church of God is guided by the ſame ſpirit: and as now, ſo even then alſo, there was a difference to be made betweene thoſe things which God commanded in ſuch actions, &amp; thoſe things which were ordered by men: elſe the ſcripture would neither ſo expreſly haue mentioned ſuch thinges to haue bin done by ſuch men, as in the former examples: nor S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paule haue ſpoken in his own perſon ſoe reſolutely, as in the latter. A manifeſt proofe wherof we may drawe out of the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of a matter of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, namely marriage, 1. <hi>Cor:</hi> 7. where he would not haue acknowledged, that ſome thing he ſpake by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> and ſome other things by <hi>Commandement,</hi> as in the 6. verſe, nor haue ſo exactly diſtinguiſhed between the <hi>Lord commandeth</hi> &amp; not <hi>I,</hi> ſpeaking of equal mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, verſe. 10. and <hi>I commande,</hi> and <hi>not the Lord,</hi> ſpeaking of vnequal marriages, verſe. 12. But onely to giue vs to vnderſtand, that in theſe matters of ceremony and outward order, where he vſeth not Gods expreſſe authoritie, there he ſpeaketh of his owne iudgment, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected alwaies, as him ſelfe veryly thinketh. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.40. by the ſpirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto J haue ſpoken only of thoſe things, wherin I wold willingly be inſtructed, concerning the Leiturgies of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t til the Apoſtles times.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4537:12"/>
we may gather this firme and ſure Concluſion, That therfore the Ceremonies of thoſe times were certainely of <hi>humane ordinance:</hi> or, to ſpeake more properly, of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall Conſtitution.</hi> For had God given any law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither could the Jewiſh rites haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long, neither could they haue bin ſo divers as they were, neither could they haue bin of ſo free obſeruation, but that one church muſt needs haue bin ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalized by a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother.

Before I come to anſwere the propoſition, J deſire the Reader a litle to obſerue the Treatiſers phraſe, and manner of ſpeech. His phraſe is <hi>becomming an Idoll:</hi> will you know the reaſon? Hee had not ſpoken home enough, if hee had only ſaid <hi>being abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> for the word <hi>abuſed,</hi> would haue implied a good vſe once, which the Treatiſer perhaps will not admit that there was ever any of the Croſſe. Neither thought he it ſufficient to ſay <hi>abuſed to Idolatrie,</hi> for then perhaps, it would haue been too hard a taſke for him to proue, that <hi>nothing abuſed to Idolatrie</hi> may lawfully be vſed in Gods ſervice. And therefore there was no remedy, his phraſe muſt needs be, <hi>becomming an Idoll.</hi> But how, I praie you, may a humane ordinance become an Idoll? Doe you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende by this ſpeech a <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> or <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> whereby it ceaſeth to be the nature it was, and is turned into a nature it vvas not? But that is cleane againſt the Apoſtles minde, who ſaith that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolum nihil eſt in mundo.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.4.</note> Your meaning then muſt bee, that by the cogitation and minde of men, aſcribing <hi>deity</hi> to the <hi>ordinance,</hi> it was framed and made an Idol. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>eſsence</hi> and <hi>becomming</hi> it can haue none. What then needed this far fetched ſpeech <hi>becomming an Idoll?</hi> But that perhaps you meant thereby to expreſſe your

zeale, or rather, as I ſuppoſe, to aſtoniſh the ignorant, &amp; make the ſigne of the Croſſe more ſuſpected, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the people. But leauing the Treatiſers ſpeech let vs come vnto his matter.</p>
                  <p>And here J muſt debate a litle with the Treatiſer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>matter</hi> of an <hi>Idoll,</hi> (for the forme we ſee by the Apoſtles doctrine is none, but only in the minde and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of the Jdolater) whether J ſay, the matter of an <hi>Idoll,</hi> being ſiluer or golde, braſſe, leade, or ſtone, &amp;c. after it is altered &amp; reclaymed from the Jdolatrous vſe, may not aſwell be vſed in Gods ſeruice, as Churches, or Lands, or veſſels may, which ſometimes haue beene conſecrated vnto Jdols: J am of opinion it may.

Fourthly, it is not <hi>without fruit,</hi> but doth admoniſh the faithful, with what <hi>modeſtie, religion,</hi> and <hi>obſervance</hi> they ſhould han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <hi>holy myſteries.</hi> Two things are commonly obiected by the Treatiſers friends againſt the ſigne of the Croſſe in Baptiſme.

Theſe two obiections doe vtterly thwart &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow each the other. Againſt the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Caluin</hi> in this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is mainely oppoſite, who here requireth in the decencie of every ceremony, that it <hi>be not without fruit, &amp;c.</hi> intimating therby, that ſuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as are not <hi>ſignificant,</hi> muſt needs be vaine. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>firſt:</hi> I am to anſwere now, &amp; I doubt not but it wil appeare, to be of much <hi>fruit,</hi> and to very <hi>good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> if it do admoniſh vs of theſe things. And that it ſo doth, J declare thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> it admoniſheth vs of <hi>modeſtie,</hi> becauſe it is as a watchword, &amp; ſecret remembrance, to keepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, the grand <hi>impugner</hi> of <hi>modeſty,</hi> &amp; mother of ſhame, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to minde, whatſoeuer Chriſt hath wrought, and we

Firſt <hi>negatiue,</hi> it is not thought <hi>neceſſary</hi> vnto <hi>ſalvation,</hi> nor in that reſpect to <hi>binde the conſcience.</hi> Secondly, it is not receiued with any opinion of <hi>divine worſhip</hi> thereto belonging. <hi>Affirmatiue,</hi> it is accompanied with that <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> that is required in al honeſt actions.

                  <p>Secondly, that the ſigne of the Croſſe is <hi>become an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll.</hi> And herein lurketh, the whole deceipt of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſers Sophiſme, who becauſe it is confeſſed, that the Croſſe hath beene abuſed among the Papiſts, and vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, <hi>cultu latriae,</hi> as himſelfe afterward ſheweth, would therevpon inferre, that therefore the ſigne of the Croſſe in Baptiſme, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be wel vſed by vs Proteſtants.

Neither is this ſpoken without good reaſon, for nothing is properly an Idoll, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus eſt viſibilis forma, ſed quatenus religioſè colitur. If therfore it be worſhiped, it may be an Idoll, though it be no viſible ſhape: otherwiſe the worſhipping of Angells &amp; the ſoules of the iuſt men, were no Idolatry, ſeeing theſe are inuiſible ſpirits. And therfore the ſigne of the Croſſe, if it be religiouſly worſhipped, may proue an Idoll, though it bee, tranſiens quiddam, a thing vaniſhing in the aire, and no permanent forme. For as that learned <hi>Zanchie</hi> ſpeaketh, there is, duplex Idolum, the one reall, the other, imaginariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; tantum mente conceptum.</p>
                     <p>For anſwere to the ſecond Queſtion. Men may keepe themſelues from Idolls two wayes, viz. a cultu, &amp; ab vſu Idoli, from the worſhip, and from the vſe of the Idoll. For the first S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paule is ſo strict, that he alloweth not the Chriſtians, ſo much as to be preſent in the Temple, at the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4537:23"/>
Idolatrous feasts, though they did it without any internall opinion, or externall action of worſhipping the Idoll.</p>
                     <p>But Iohn in this place doth not ſpeake ſo much of the worſhipping, as the vſe of the Idoll, for (as Auguſtine in pſal: <hi>113.</hi> well obſerueth) the Apoſtle commandeth, vt caueant non tantum a cultu ſimulacrorum, ſed a ſimulacris ipſis, that they avoid not only the worſhip of the Images, but alſo the Images or Idols themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Now the vſe of an Image or Idol may be ciuil, or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and both of them, publike, or priuate.</p>
                     <p>That an Image, euen ſuch an Image as is Idolatrouſly worſhipped, may be made and reteined for ciuil reſpects, of ornament, ſtory, or ſuch like, we make no queſtion, though the tolerating of them in open and publike places, euen extra cultum, be offenſiue, and turne into a ſnare, as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acons Ephod was to his poſterity, when it was abuſed to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie. And vpon this ground we yeeld, that though the Croſse be apparantly an Idoll, yet in Princes banners, coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, coyne, Crowne, or any other ciuil reſpect, it may haue lawfull vſe. But that anything of mans deuiſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſhipped as an Idoll, ſhould be vſed, Religionis ergô, and in the worſhipping of God, ſeemeth directly againſt S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

                     <p n="1">1 Theſe words. <hi>That an Image, even ſuch an Image, as is Idolatrouſly worſhipped, may be made, and retained for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill reſpects of ornament, and ſuch like, there is no queſtion though the tolerating of them, in open and publike places, even</hi> extra cultum, <hi>be offenſiue, &amp; turne into a ſnare, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt part, <hi>That they may bee made and retained for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill reſpects of ornament or ſuch like,</hi> we eaſily grant: but thoſe other words, <hi>Though the tolerating of them, bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue, &amp; turne into a ſnare,</hi> ſound harſh in mine eares, not only becauſe they containe a flat contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Treatiſers owne words a little after, where he ſaith, that without doubt, the meaning of the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4537:24"/>
is, to binde the Church from al ſuch ſnares, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to ſin, and that al occaſions &amp; meanes leading thervnto, are likewiſe prohibited: but eſpecially, becauſe they containe a contradiction to the truth. For <hi>what els</hi> gaue occaſion to <hi>Jdolatry</hi> at the firſt, but the <hi>vaine glory</hi> of men, making <hi>ſtatues,</hi> and <hi>portracts</hi> of their <hi>triumphes,</hi> and for the <hi>memory</hi> of them whom they loued? Which at the firſt were <hi>civill reſpects,</hi> but when they came to bee a ſnare, were no better then Jdols. Had the Treatiſer well obſerved the nature of the words, which he here deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, he would haue found, that nothing is <hi>Scandalum, offenſiue,</hi> or a ſtumbling blocke, til it bee ſet to make men ſtumble: nor a <hi>ſnare,</hi> till it be laid to catch and intangle. Such things are no longer tollerated, then while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their civil reſpects: if once they become <hi>offenſiue,</hi> and <hi>ſnares,</hi>

                     <p>Againe, if this ſpeech of the Treatiſers be true, as hee maks no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what reaſon hath he to be more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>an Jmage, even ſuch an image as is Jdolatrouſly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped though &amp;c.</hi> then to our Croſſe in Baptiſm, which is neither an <hi>image,</hi> nor <hi>Idolatrouſly worſhipped,</hi> nor <hi>retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, cum opinione cultus,</hi> nor <hi>offenſiue,</hi> or a <hi>ſnare</hi> to any, but ſuch as wilbe offended without cauſe?

ſhew, that to vſe a thing, <hi>Religionis ergô,</hi> ſignifieth to vſe a thing in the outward ſeruice of God the Treatiſer knows well enough, that theſe ſpeaches differ, &amp; beare not the ſame meaning: and yet is content to faſten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, that we vſe the Croſſe <hi>Religionis ergô,</hi> which is a moſt <hi>malitious</hi> calumniation. And J muſt tel him the more plainly of this iuggling, becauſe he vſeth it very much, and thinks it a fit bait to catch the ſimple. True it is, we vſe the ſigne of the Croſſe, in a <hi>religious action,</hi> namely in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> but we vſe it not <hi>Religionis ergô,</hi> with anie <hi>conceipt</hi> or <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that we aſcribe vnto it; and this I giue the Reader as a perpetual caveat, againſt the grand impoſture of the Treatiſer. Jn vaine therfore is that which he addeth of the <hi>Church of England, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving &amp; commending of Tertullians interpretation of this place of</hi> Iohn, worthely it is approved, and commended, as moſt fit and agreeable therevnto. <hi>Tertullian</hi> never meant thoſe words againſt the ſign of the Croſſe in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, of which he alwaies ſpeaketh moſt honorably: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that <hi>Homilie,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe apply his teſtimony, then to the deteſtation both of the ſervice or worſhipping, and alſo of the very ſhapes and likenes of the <hi>Images or Idols them ſelues,</hi> his wordes there, are <hi>effigies &amp; imago</hi> as the ſame <hi>Homily</hi> doth well obſerue.

it. For ſurely if Idolatry it ſelfe, as a moſt execrable thing, be forbidden, then all occaſions &amp; meanes leading thervnto are likewiſe prohibited, &amp; what ſtronger provocation to that ſpiritual whoredome, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erecting Images, in the place of Gods worſhip? <hi>Plus enim, vt rectè Auguſtinus in Pſalm. 113. valent ſimulacra ad curuandam infeliccm animam, quòd os habent, nares habent, manus habent, pedes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, quàm ad corrigendam quòd non loquentur, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debunt, non audient, non odorabunt, non tractabunt, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ambulabunt.</hi>

                     <p>The like we may finde in <hi>Epiphanius, ad Johannem E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopum Hieroſol.</hi> where he reporteth, that finding an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt or ſome Saint hanging at a Church dore, he rent it in peeces, avouching, that to hange a picture in the Church of Christ, was <hi>contra autoritatem ſcripturarum, contra religionem Chriſtianam,</hi> contrary to the authority of the ſcriptures, and the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

For Gideons Ephod being firſt a ciuill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of victory, when the people went a whoring after it, was it lawfull for the Magistrat, to erect in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle or Sinagogue, though not the ſame yet the like, both in name &amp; forme to any religious vſe?

                           <p>But he proveth it: for <hi>in the late Canons, it is ſaid, that the child is therby dedicated vnto the ſervice of him, that died on the Croſſe, what is this but to equall mans ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with Gods? And to aſcribe that vnto the Croſse, which is due vnto Baptiſme? A conceipt fitter for ignorant Papiſts then learned Chriſtians to aſſent vnto.</hi> If wee aſſented ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to the one or to the other, it were indeede not onlie a <hi>conceipt fitter for ignorant Papiſts, then learned Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but alſo an <hi>opinion erroneous and ſuperſtitious,</hi> and which is more, <hi>prowd, inſolent,</hi> and <hi>preſumptious too.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But how doth the word <hi>dedicated,</hi> inforce thus much: namely, <hi>becauſe the Sacrament, which is Gods ordinance, can doe no more but Dedicate the Infant, to the ſervice of him that died on the Croſse. And therefore when wee ſaie, the ſigne of the Croſse, which is but mans invention, doeth Dedicate, doe we not equallmans ordinance with Gods? &amp; aſcribe that vnto the Croſse which is due vnto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> J anſwere, no: For <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> doth more then <hi>dedicate only,</hi> for it <hi>really giueth</hi> that which it <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi> &amp; is to the child that, which it doth <hi>ſignifie.</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> neither <hi>giueth</hi> any thing to the child, nor <hi>promiſeth,</hi> nor is any other thing, then an <hi>outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> only, ſignifying that the child hereafter ſhould not be aſhamed to confeſſe the faith of Chriſt crucified &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the word <hi>Dedicate</hi> doth not alwaies ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> or to <hi>Conſecrate,</hi> but ſomtimes to <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate,</hi> to <hi>appoint</hi> to ſome ſpecial vſe, to declare and teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, that the thing is aſſigned, addicted, and called out to ſuch, for ſuch a ſeueral <hi>purpoſe, office perſon,</hi> or <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</hi> And this is moſt manifeſt, by that vſe of this word, which is moſt ordinary and common in our ſpeach: As namely to <hi>dedicate</hi> a book to a great perſonage, is not in in our language to conſecrate, &amp; ſanctifie it vnto him, but by that word of <hi>Dedication,</hi> we teſtifie and declare our loue, duty, &amp; affection towards him, &amp; appoint the book ſo dedicated, to be a manifeſt ſigne, token, proofe, argument, and declaration of our loue. The word <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> therfore being Eccleſiaſticall, and very frequent in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4537:53"/>
this ſignification, it was thought fitt to be retained in this matter, rather then to take in a word more ſtrang &amp; nothing ſo ſignificant: Eſpecially conſidering, that ther are many words, and ſentences in that Canon, both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue and negatiue, very ſufficient to declare, and make manifeſt vnto al reaſonable men, that the Church of England doeth not attribute any ſanctifiing, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating of the child to the ſeruice of Chriſt, vnto any <hi>vertue, grace, or power,</hi> of, or in the ſigne of the Croſſe.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly though both the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the <hi>ſigne</hi> of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>dedicate,</hi> yet they doe not both dedicate <hi>after the ſame ſort,</hi> for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate <hi>as a ſigne, and as a Sacrament too,</hi> the <hi>Croſſe</hi> as <hi>a ſigne</hi> or <hi>ceremony only,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> doth dedicate as a <hi>cauſe efficient inſtrumentall, working inwardly,</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Gods ſpirite, the <hi>Croſse</hi> doth dedicate as a cauſe <hi>declaratory, teſtimonial, witneſſing outwardly</hi> to the Church, and to the partie that is baptized. And ſo much the very wordes of the Canon woulde haue taught you, but that you would not learne, when it ſaith, <hi>Accounting it a lawfull outward Ceremony, and honorable badge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Infant is dedicated, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The wearing of a badge, or cognizance of ſome noble man, or the colours of ſome Captaine, doth not, J hope, in your apprehenſion, make the ſervant or ſouldior that weareth it, to be of ſuch a noble mans retinew, or ſuch a captaines regiment. But becauſe he is of that retinewe, he weareth that badge or cognizance, and becauſe hee is of that regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he weareth thoſe colours. And yet both the one and the other, doth make other men to know, &amp; withall doth put himſelfe in remembrance, that ſuch a noble mans man, or ſuch a captaines ſouldior hee is, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4537:53"/>
ſuch he ought to ſhew himſelfe to be. Even ſo it is in the matter of the Croſſe. The ſigne of the Croſſe maketh not the childe to be the ſervant, or ſouldior of Chriſt, but becauſe by Baptiſme he is ſo made, therfore he is ſigned with that honorable badge, that thereby, both other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may know that he is the ſervant, and ſouldiour of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Declaratorie quoad alios, memorativè, et monitoriè quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad ſcipſum.</note> and himſelfe may be remembred, and admoniſed, that he is in al his life to ſhew himſelfe as the faithfull ſervant of ſuch a maſter, and the couragious ſouldiour of ſuch a captaine: Which our Communion book moſt wiſely, &amp; beyond all exception of malice, ſetteth downe in theſe religious tearmes. <hi>In token that he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſſe the faith of Chriſt crucified, and manfully to fight vnder his banner, againſt ſin, the world, and the Divel, and to continue his faithfull ſouldiour and ſervant vnto his liues end.</hi>
